Humorously, as the girls discuss which is the smartest, most elegant, strongest, and the leader of the Senshi, Usagi claims those titles for herself. Chibiusa shakes her head at Usagi's delusion. Clips are shown from the debut of each Sailor Senshi, and that girl's image song is played in the background. When even Tuxedo Mask is mentioned, and the girls go to leave without having mentioned Sailor Moon, Usagi butts in on their conversation and asks them directly about Sailor Moon. The girls give a series of glowing compliments about Sailor Moon, but unlike they did for the other Senshi, they also list her faults. After the girls leave, Usagi sarcastically apologises for being a clumsy cry-baby and then bursts into tears.

Based on a seinen manga by Shinobu Ohtaka, serialized in Young Gangan.

Koushi Inuzuka is a smart high school student who aims to become a public prosecutor. Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.

Skip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.

Meanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her ""husband."" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them? More importantly, will Momoko get her way receiving a baby from Koushi?",,2007,2007-08-24,,Studio Hibari,Comedy;Romance;Ecchi,402

As Ataru Moroboshi's mother recalls, her relatively peaceful middle-class lifestyle ended about six months ago, when alien invaders known as the Oni appeared on Earth. Their leader, Mr. Invader, offered to spare the planet if a randomly selected human could defeat his daughter Lum in a game of tag. As luck would have it, the fate of the planet rested on the shoulders of the housewife's troublesome son. In a turn of events, the challenge ended with young Ataru's victory—and with his royal opponent becoming an inadvertent addition to the Moroboshi household.

Ataru's mother reflects on all the characters her son has been involved with—friends and foes, both human and extraterrestrial—and the stress their antics have caused her. Unsure whether to admire her son's fortitude or consider him pathetic, Mother Morobashi can only muse if her family will ever experience peace and quiet again.

Meanwhile, Ataru finds his school excursion to the ancient capital of Nara tedious. However, stumbling upon the scroll and gaining Kaede's attention makes his field trip a little more interesting.

Invulnerable to conventional damage, only ""Oracle Cell"" weapons—composed of the same matter which makes up Aragami—can kill these creatures.

However, due to their god-like ability to adapt, the Aragami soon develop further immunity. Having no other hope of fending off the enemy, the remnants of human governments decide to detonate a nuclear reactor and wipe out the monsters facing Eurasia.

The soldiers tasked with this mission are aided by three ""God Eaters"" dispatched from the Fenrir Far East Branch, an organization controlling what remains of Japan. The state-of-the-art weapons they wield, called God Arcs, are supposedly capable of piercing through Aragami skin and tearing their cores out, pulverizing the monsters. These mighty warriors may just be humanity's last hope of fending off the Aragami threat and averting total extinction.

In the end, Eureka and Renton must part ways, but Renton vows that they will meet again someday, no matter what. 

Episode 51 has absolutely no relation to Eureka Seven's sequel ""Eureka Seven AO"", as this was a real ending that was not used for the original TV run of the series. Eureka Seven AO continues from the events that happened in Episode 50: Wish Upon a Star.

From East Asian folklore, Okushita takes the symbol of the red string of fate. There are many variations of this ancient tale, but the main idea is that the gods tie men and women together who are destined as each other's soul mates together with a red thread.

An invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet,
regardless of time, place, or circumstance.
The thread may stretch or tangle, but it will never break.

Whether it's hanging out with friends or cramming for tests, everyone has something they will remember from that time in their lives. At a certain high school, one class is faced with an event that can cause people to look back on their high school days in sadness: the death of a student.

The deceased is not just any student—she's Tomie Kawakami, a popular girl with an almost otherworldly beauty. Her death was particularly gruesome: her body was dismembered and the pieces scattered. As the class tries to make sense of the situation, they are shocked when a familiar voice calls out to them from the doorway, apologizing for being late.

He teamed up with Takahata for the later episodes of the 1971-72 Lupin III series, but Yuki's Sun marked his first time solely in the captain's seat.

Yuki's Sun was based upon a popular shoujo manga (girls' comic) by Tetsuya Chiba which was serialized in 1963. It involves a 10-year-old orphan girl who is adopted into a family. The storyline is somewhat complex, and seems to play out like grand melodrama. Chiba's stories were more sophisticated and grown-up than, say, Osamu Tezuka, who of course was the godfather of postwar Japanese manga.

Though the CG was primitive, (the rendering and models aren’t much better than that seen in Resident Evil 2, it’s certainly not on par with Resident Evil 3) it told the story enough. Below is a summary of the events within the 20 minute movie. 

The story focuses on an elite unit of 5 UBCS members, sent into Raccoon City to try and rescue Dr. Cameron. An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron’s last known location, which is near a large food factory. 

Upon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis.

Worried about her weight, Karen Inukai decides to head to the pool and invites her friend Mike Nekotani to come along. Unbeknownst to the dog-phobic Nekotani, their destination is no regular swimming pool—it is a dog pool, where Inukai plans to play with her beloved Pochita. Unfortunately for the trio, Nekotani's fear of dogs soon puts their day of peaceful recreation in jeopardy.

Gakuensai Date.
The school festival is here, and Inukai has finally gotten a break from working at her class' dog cafe. She takes this opportunity to bring Pochita on a date, but the two immediately run into Inukai's self-proclaimed rival for Pochita's affection, Usagi Tsukishiro, who insists on tagging along. Their tour of the festival attractions soon brings them to a haunted house. When the horrors inside prove too much for both Inukai and Tsukishiro to handle, it is up to Pochita to calm the girls down.

The aircraft shown in the video closely evokes the forward-swept-wing YF-19/VF-19 variable fighter designs first seen in Macross Plus and Macross 7, but appears to also draw inspiration from real-life fighter craft, with canards common in European fighters, and an air intake similar to the F-16. The iconic motif of hands in the shape of a fighter also first appeared in Macross Plus.

Kawamori designed the case that will ship alongside the Wena Wrist product. The watch itself is a mechanical design, evoking pilot watch-style elements. The dial's design evokes the attitude indicator/artificial horizon seen on fighter instrument panels, with one side being an open-heart design showing the mechanical movement. The 12:00 position is indicated by a white arrow, common to many pilot watches.

Additionally, a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy; in other words, the robot does not require a power-generating company. In addition to this, the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space. 

The unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural, and it is clear that he created this piece, as it was intentionally, as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay, animation, narration, etc., all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company.

Once there, Taku and his family meet up with Louis Boudre and David Flight, two humans with supernatural abilities. Taku is able to learn telekinesis from these two men. Soon after, they are all seized against their will by a strange man, and transported 500 million years in the past to the moon. There, Taku meets Price Noman, and it's up to them and the Noman Rangers to put a stop to the intergalactic war between humans and aliens.

The pilot was partially in color, and ran for exactly 12 minutes and 20 seconds. It is unknown why the pilot was never serialized, but one could speculate that it was because of financial reasons. Another pilot made around the same time, Zero Man, was cancelled early into production due to Mushi Pro struggling to fund the show. Seeing as how the Noman pilot was nearly three times as long as the Zero Man pilot, it's easy to see how Mushi Pro would struggle financially with such a production.

He despises the attention he draws at school with his bouts of loud hyperventilating, extended coughing fits, and exemption from physical education as well as military service. Whether suffering through the curiosity or ire of his classmates, Myeongyi is left feeling like a complete outcast. However, the class president Han Seonho often shows Myeongyi kindness and understanding. With his friendly gestures and handsome looks, he becomes Myeongyi's first crush.

Nine years later, Myeongyi attends his high school reunion for only one reason: to see Han Seonho once again. He holds a tiny glimmer of hope about the other man's feelings for him—but after seeing the bright gold ring on Seonho's left hand and listening to their classmates' prying questions, that hope is quickly dashed. Excusing himself to go take a smoke, regardless of the state of his lungs, Myeongyi is followed outside by Seonho. Unexpectedly, that marks the beginning of their illicit love affair.
