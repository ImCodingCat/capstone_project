The video is composed of short, colorful, and poorly drawn clips of memes, anime shows, news broadcasts, and clickbait. They are interspersed with advertisements for a cure-all ""Law-Evading Rock,"" depicted as a rainbow-colored disk. Datsu, who is entranced by the stream of clips, blindly follows the advertisements. Near the end of the song, Datsu is tapped on the shoulder by the male group featured on TV. The leader inserts a ""Law-Evading Rock"" disk into Datsu's back. The video then dissolves into a chaotic mix of clips from earlier in the video, with Datsu depicted as having seemingly achieved enlightenment and become a many-armed bodhisattva.

The theme of thoughtcrime is plagiarized from George Orwell's novel, ""1984."" Then, the moment it was declared that it's plagiarized, the plagiarized work changed form into a homage. The line between doing plagiarism and doing a homage seems ambiguous, and the truth is that that line doesn't exist anywhere. It holds true even when the role is reversed. A homage holds a great risk of becoming plagiarism. The lyrics to this song pays homage to Ozaki Housai's haiku and his final years of life.

Here comes the end
Our land is brutally torn apart by conglomerates
Redevelopment swept across the city
Their thriving business had left us homeless

Rotten city, rotten crowd
Luxury clothing won't conceal the stench
Top yourself and throw a curse
Fill the streets with our merry hearses

Is the world going to end
as we've been longing for?
Destroy us all together with the chaos
Set us free like
the ashes in the wind

Some people embraced religion and believed that God would deliver them from suffering. After humanity was enslaved by aliens, no one spoke of God any longer.

Now the grim truth is that humans are mere property of aliens. Recently, entering pet humans into the entertainment industry has become popular, and the biggest, most thrilling spectacle is known as Alien Stage. In this reality singing competition, alien sponsors flaunt their investments, while human contestants must battle to survive. No matter the relationship between opponents—whether it is love, hate, or something more extreme—only one victor can emerge each round.

This production does not feature any humans, and replacing all familiar elements of the non-existent singers and orchestras are aria and recitative by Hatsune Miku and Vocaloid, with a story told by computer-made music and visuals.

This production tests taking the traditional tragic structure of an opera asking ""What is death?"" and ""What is an end?"" and puts Hatsune Miku as the mediator to reread it in a modern way.

They drive around in a light truck and collect broken TVs, computers, and other items while playing silly announcements over the speaker.

Their office is in a corner of a multi-tenant building and calls itself a recycle shop, but most of it looks like a warehouse with junk lined up with price tags. Before long, the four of them start receiving requests for junk that they can't handle on their own and by chance the abandoned items end up in GUMI's hands.

Meanwhile, in the city center, an environmental beautification organization is formed and a cleanup operation for the downtown area is about to begin, under the pretext of redeveloping the area into a beautiful town. GUMI and the others rebel against the way of life in the downtown area that is gradually being threatened. As the government and beautification organizations each have their own agenda, breaking news breaks that a dangerous creature has been found on the garbage dump and a drastic move is made to clean up the dump, along with the downtown area, turning it into a vacant lot.
